                    <h3 class="section-heading"> <b>How do we work with them?</b> </h3>
                    <p class="text-faded"> Every month, we will donate the reward generated by the pool and exchange it for trees to be planted around the world. These trees will be issued an ID that will allow our delegators to track them and their development. </p>


                    <h3 class="section-heading"><b>Why Treedom?</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">We chose this project because of their <b>impact</b> -  not only <b>ecological</b> - but within the <b>communities</b> being supported by this initiative. Also due to its <b>traceability </b>, that allow us to have maximum transparency with our delegators.</p>
                    <p class="text-faded">Each tree will then be planted and will be <b>traceable</b> - thanks to their <b>ID</b> system that allows you to have information on:
                      <ul class="text-faded">
                        <li><b>Where</b> the tree has been planted</li>
                        <li><b>Who</b> is the farmer that is caring for the tree</li>
                        <li><b>How</b>  is it doing - with an up-to-date <b>photo tag</b>.</li>
                       </ul>

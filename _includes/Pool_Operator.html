                <hr class="light">
                <p class="text-faded"> Living in the Sunny Mediterranean Corsica. My background is in Biotechnology. I aim to help mitigate climate change, by integrating an understanding of ecological impact with technological development.</p>
                <p class="text-faded"> I have been following Cardano closely and wish to be a part of the community - by dedicating myself to learn how to build, run, secure and maintain a node stake pool. </p>
                <p class="text-faded">'Ada for trees' was born from a desire to create a strong link between Cardano and my passion for Nature. Using the stake pool to generate income to help reforestation projects is the perfect way to give back to the planet. With ADA value going up and a fairly amount of delegation, a fee of only 2% can make a massive difference. And the delegators still earn 98% of the profits, myself included. This is a perfect win-win situation where we all share both wins. </p>

                    <hr class="light">
                    <p class="text-faded"> Treedom is an organisation that collaborates with small farmers all over the world to help them integrate a more sustainable agricultural system - Agroforestry. </p>
                    <p class="text-faded"> Agroforestry consists in cultivating native species integrated with the ecosystem where they are farmed. </p>
                    <p class="text-faded"> Treedom educates farmers in these best agricultural practices, while supporting them through the 'growth phase' (while the trees are not yet productive).</p>
                    <p class="text-faded"> This results in a sustainable economical development for the farmers and their communities. Ensuring that our investement in trees plantation will 'bear fruits' and capture CO2 for generations!</p>

                    <p class="text-faded"> <b>How do we work with them?</b> </p>
                    <p class="text-faded"> Treedom has a website where people can buy trees. </p>
                    <p class="text-faded">Those will then be planted and will be traceable, thanks to their ID system that allows you to have information:
                      <ul>
                        <li>where the tree has been planted<li/>
                        <li>information about the farmer that is caring for that tree<li/>
                        <li>even an updated photo tag.<li/>
                         <ul/>
                      </p>
                    <p class="text-faded"> We chose this project because of their <b>impact</b> -  not only <b>ecological</b> - but within the <b>communities</b> being supported by this initiative. Also due to its <b>traceability </b>- we wanted to be able to trace and see our investement actually grow and give fruits. </p>

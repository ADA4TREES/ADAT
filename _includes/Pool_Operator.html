                <hr class="light">
                <p class="text-faded">I'm Cris from Sunny Mediterranean Corsica.
                <br>With a Biotechnology background - Sustainability and Conservation are my main concerns.
                <br>
                Being a Technology enthusiast myself,I believe that by integrating an understanding between ecological impact and technological development, we can create solutions to mitigate our impact on major global issues like <b>climate change</b> and <b>food scarcity</b>.
               <br>The blockchain technology creates the grounds needed to implement these ideas in a global prespective. It brings the transparency and security needed for a new generation of technological and social development. Where our action are tracked and accounted for and our progress can be accurately measured.
              <br>
              This is why I am invested in Cardano. The scientific aproach of the project and the sustainability values of the network made me commit to the community. Doing so by being an active member and efficiently running a stake pool.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Our Choosen Charity: Treedom </h2>
                    <p class="text-faded"> Treedom collaborates with small farmers all over the world to help them integrate a more sustainable agricultural system - Agroforestry.</p>

                  <h3 class="section-heading"> What is Agroforestry?</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded"> Agroforestry is a <b>Sustainable Agricultural Practice</b> that also provides <b>Food Security</b> for the farmers and their communities boosting their <b>economical development</b>.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading"> <b>How do we work with them?</b> </h3>
                    <p class="text-faded"> Every month, we will donate the reward generated by the pool and exchange it for trees to be planted around the world. These trees will be issued an ID that will allow our delegators to track them and their development. </p>


                    <h3 class="section-heading"><b>Why Treedom?</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">We chose this project because of their <b>impact</b> -  not only <b>ecological</b> - but within the <b>communities</b> being supported by this initiative. Also due to its <b>traceability </b>, that allow us to have maximum transparency with our delegators.</p>
                    <p class="text-faded">Each tree will then be planted and will be <b>traceable</b> - thanks to their <b>ID</b> system that allows you to have information on:
                      <ul class="text-faded">
                        <li><b>Where</b> the tree has been planted</li>
                        <li><b>Who</b> is the farmer that is caring for the tree</li>
                        <li><b>How</b>  is it doing - with an up-to-date <b>photo tag</b>.</li>
                       </ul>

                <hr class="light">
                <p class="text-faded">I'm Cris, living in the Sunny Mediterranean Corsica.
                With a background in Biotechnology - Sustainability and Conservation of our Natural Systems are my main concerns.
                I belief that by integrating an understanding between ecological impact and technological development, we can create solutions to mitigate our impact on major issues like <b>climate change</b> and <b>food scarcity</b>
                <br><br>
                Being a Technology enthusiast, I am interested in blockchain technology, and since I was introduced to the Cardano, I've been following the project closely and learned how to build, secure and maintain a node stake pool. </p>
                <br>
                <p class="text-faded"><b>'Ada for trees'</b> was born from a desire to create awareness within the Cardano for topics like: <b>Conservation, Reforestation and Sustainable Development</b>.</p>

                  <h3 class="section-heading"> What is Treedom?</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded"> Treedom collaborates with small farmers all over the world to help them integrate a more sustainable agricultural system - Agroforestry.</p>

                  <h3 class="section-heading"> What is Agroforestry?</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded"> Agroforestry is a <b>Sustainable Agricultural Practice</b> that also provides <b>Food Security</b> for the farmers and their communities boosting their <b>economical development</b>.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading"> <b>How do we work with them?</b> </h3>
                    <p class="text-faded"> Every month, we will donate the reward generated by the pool and exchange it for trees to be planted around the world. These trees will be issued an ID that will allow our delegators to track them and their development. </p>


                    <h3 class="section-heading"><b>Why Treedom?</h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">We chose this project because of their <b>impact</b> -  not only <b>ecological</b> - but within the <b>communities</b> being supported by this initiative. Also due to its <b>traceability </b>, that allow us to have maximum transparency with our delegators.</p>
                    <p class="text-faded">Each tree will then be planted and will be <b>traceable</b> - thanks to their <b>ID</b> system that allows you to have information on:
                      <ul class="text-faded">
                        <li><b>Where</b> the tree has been planted</li>
                        <li><b>Who</b> is the farmer that is caring for the tree</li>
                        <li><b>How</b>  is it doing - with an up-to-date <b>photo tag</b>.</li>

                <p class="text-faded">We convert ADA Rewards generated from running Stake Pools for the Cardano's Blockchain into green credits. A step forward towards a Net Zero Carbon Emissions Blockchain. We want to support Reforestation, doing it mindfully and assuring the Sustainable Future of the Forest and the Communities depending on them. Our impact will grow in sync with ADA and the number of delegation to our pool. Join Us! Delegate to ADAT. And turn ADA into trees! </p>
